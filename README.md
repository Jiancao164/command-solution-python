Instruction: Directly open the project in any IDE. The project contains two files. One is source code(main.py), and the other one is Junit Test(CommandTest.py). Run the Test file, and it will first create a simulation of directory with the following structure. Then it will test the solution with different inputs in the directory. 

Assume such directory is in the system: 

		|--def -- ghi
